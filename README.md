With crime rates rising it is critical to look at which areas are the most dangerous, which are the safest and places to avoid. Our team was able to collect data sets from multiple sources which will help to prevent and avoid any life threatening crimes. 

The main crimes currently happening across the GTA are shootings, stabbings, assault, auto theft, break and entry, and Robbery. By examining the data collected it was evident that Downtown has the most crimes committed with the majority of it being assaults. 

The steps taken to document the records and data collected are the following:


	Using Python to clean and organize the data.
	Creating Visualizations by HTML and Javascript.
	Making barcharts, pie charts and line graphs in Javascript.
	Maps made by Leaflet built from data gathered through web scraping.
	A dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data.
	The dashboards contain multiple features such as dropdowns, filters, or a zoom feature.

The big question that was addressed is what are the major crimes happening in Toronto?
